## Organizational Approach

**Preparation Phase**: It is essential to establish a CyberSecurity Incident Response Team (CSIRT), define appropriate lines of communication, articulate services necessary to support response activities, and procure the necessary tools.

**Identification & Assessment Phase**: Identifying an event and conducting an assessment should be performed to confirm the existence of an incident. The assessment should include determining the scope, impact, and extent of the damage caused by the incident. In the event of possible legal action, digital evidence will be preserved, and forensic analysis may be conducted consistently with legislative and legal requirements.

**Containment & Intelligence Phase**: Containment of the incident is necessary to minimize and isolate the damage caused. We must take steps to ensure that the scope of the incident does not spread to include other systems and Information Resources.

**Eradication Phase**: Eradication requires removal or addressing of all components and symptoms of the incident. Further, validation must be performed to ensure the incident does not reoccur. 

**Recovery Phase**: Recovery involves the steps required to restore data and systems to a healthy working state allowing business operations to be returned.

**Lessons Learned Phase**: The Lessons Learned phase includes post-incident analysis on the system(s) that were affected by the incident and other potentially vulnerable systems. Lessons learned from the incident are communicated to executive management and action plans developed to improve future incident management practices and reduce risk exposure.
